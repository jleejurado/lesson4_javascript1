### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. I learned how important it is to have an algorithim planned out for the code. Without it, I would not have been able to confidently determine which variable I needed to declare.
2. I learned how important it is to keep track of the variable names and methods. I often found myself mixing up things like householdAmt and householdPct, something that would be detremental to the final code if not corrected.
3. I am learning to be more comfortable using GitHub. Previously, I found the website hard to navigate without directly consulting the instructions. However I am now learning more about using GitHub and how to use it to its full potential.
